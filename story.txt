Tim Robertson VIII really liked to hang out at the aquarium. So much so that he insisted on holding his annual charity dinner at the location. It was the eighth time he'd planned the get-together, so he thought "OCTO FIESTA" would be just the right name for it. So, he had eight tables, banners, and an octopus shaped pinata set up in the aquarium's event space.
Across town Jill was putting the finishing touches on an exact replica to the octopus shaped pinata Tim Robertson VIII had prepared for this year's "OCTO FIESTA". With one major difference. Her's was filled with last years stale Halloween candy she'd nicked from her niece. While his, well, his was rumored to have eight extravagantly expensive prizes. What they were more specifically she had no idea but they had to be extraordinary. Tim Robertson VIII was charging 50,000 dollars a swing. It was the center piece of the charity and he would not be caught dead touching something as mandane as candy. Jill imagined the look on Tim Robertson VIII's face when the candy rained down on the crowd. He deserved this and so much more. Now she just had to make the switch. She had 48 hours and needed to get a move on. 
Jill loaded the prank octopus in the back of her minivan and started across town. It would be a 45 minute drive to the aquarium. She had dowloaded a new podcast for the drive - it was a series by students from Harvard University talking about thier experiences at Harvard and about thier various courses of study. Little did she know, the first episode was titled "Morality and Ethics: How to Forgive." She'd only been driving 10 minutes when she turned on the podcast. When she heard the title she rolled her eyes and thought "yeah, sure." Tim Roberton VIII had wronged her in too many ways she thought there was nothing on Earth that could convince her not to go through with her plan.
