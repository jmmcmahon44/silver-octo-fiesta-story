Tim Robertson VIII really liked to hang out at the aquarium. So much so that he insisted on holding his annual charity dinner at the location. It was the eighth time he'd planned the get-together, so he thought "OCTO FIESTA" would be just the right name for it. So, he had eight tables, banners, and an octopus shaped pinata set up in the aquarium's event space.
